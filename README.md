A root code for fitting and anylizing a Higgs-like signal from experimental measurements. Distinguishes between backgroung signals (quark-antiquark jets) from real H boson peaks, and fits the different statistical parameters for each plot)

You must have [ROOT - Data Analysis Framework](https://root.cern.ch/downloading-root) installed.

Once set up, you must provide some data to the algorithm to start the fitting.
